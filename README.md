"MASTERS OF THE PIXELVERSE"
***************************

Game Project In Need of a Team. Writers, pixel artists and animators, programmers (Godot preferably but that's not a deal breaker). So far I have one guy interested in music production, I will also need an audio engineer/sound designer aside from myself. The Music Producer and myself both work in Ableton Live. Again not a deal breaker but it would make things way easier if you were on it as well. So far this project is at its VERY infancy and its just hopes dreams and pixel art at this point. If we can come together and make this actually happen, We will need a person for social media and crowdfunding operations so maybe we can get this thing off the ground and maybe make a lil scratch at the end of it all. This project is about the love of doing it, Pixel art, retro SNES style games, and most of all the MASTERS OF THE UNIVERSE!! Not a beat'em up side scroller like pearl of the "dragon pearl of destruction" more so an action RPG with beat'em up aspects.     







[OUTLINE]

A pixel based Legend of Zelda 'A Link to the Past' style action rpg based off of the characters from the 'Masters of the Universe' franchise. An open world top down style game that uses a beat 'em up style battle system infused with weapons, vehicles, creatures, and magic. Unlockable items, weapons, vehicles, creatures, characters and power ups will be available for the player to earn and find, leave no stone unturned. Amongst all the action that Eternia will present the player, it will also throw fun creative puzzles at them, side quests, a card game system that will incorporate physical trading cards that can unlock special items and characters in game as well as be played as a battle card game IRL.
